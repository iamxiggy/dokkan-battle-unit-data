Dokkan Battle Unit Data in JSON format

Dumping the data that I had started accumulating. I was originally going to build an app with this data, but ended up not having enough time/interest to dedicate to it. It is ugly, it is incomplete, but hopefully someone out there can find it useful as a starting point.

It's been a while since I've worked on this but I'm thinking it was somewhere around October/November of 2020, so the data is not necessarily up-to-date if any new units have been added.

## Things I remember
* This is primarily Global data
* Transformation data is missing
* "before_eza"/"after_eza" data was added later and was a WIP when I left off
* A lot of units that are named the same, but are different types, aren't present
